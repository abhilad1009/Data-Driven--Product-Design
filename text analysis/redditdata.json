The answer may be these incredible worms. All living things grow and adapt which is exactly what the super worm has done. Something that used to just be pet food is now one of the most important things for our ecosystems survival.   \nA super worm digests plastic through the bacteria in it's gut. A test was conducted to see  what would happen if a worm ate only plastic. The control group that ate worm nutrients became slightly bigger while the experimental group did not grow, despite this the group was entirely healthy.   \nWe can use the super worms to earths advantage not only would this be good for the environment but it would create a new job and new demand for existing jobs. There would be need for super worm breeders and farmers. These people would work with waste disposal companies creating more demand for the industry.   \nIf we can simply get this information to more people then we can make the world a better place.

Sorry for the eventual mistakes, hope I can communicate well regardless.*  \n**\\*TL;DR AT THE END.**\n\nSo... first things first. since earlier this year, I have been consuming more and more information about climate change, sustainability, these important kind of things - and it has led me to be more environment-conscious than ever.   \nThing is: I live in a rather dysfunctional home. I'm 22, and (unfortunately!) still live with my parents, who are... how should I say... *less than fun* to live with. They are very difficult people for a whole lot of reasons, but I'll stick to the earth-damaging bit here. \n\n**MOTHER**  \nMy mother is freaky about cleaning everything all the time to the point that it often becomes unhealthy. Almost like by consequence, she also waste very, VERY much paper and plastic. And a lot more things, to be sincere.  \nWith \"VERY\" I mean: every time she wash her hands she dries it up with paper towel. Every time she drinks water she uses a new disposable plastic cup. Every time she comes home she puts her used clothes in a plastic bag... I could go on and on. She truly is a waste machine.   \nMom is also one of the most arrogant beings that I've ever met \u2014 so you know that \"trying to talk her out of it\" is not an option. In fact, I've been there, tried that, was involved in major family ~~havoc~~ conflicts, gave up. Well, using disposable itens is apparently very important for her to feel clean. \n\n**FATHER**  \nI also live with my father, who is (and has always been) a very permissive man. He longs for peace and silence, Mom is very angry, stressed and loud all the time. This situation led him to do everything in his power to keep balance and avoid conflict. Since I was a kid, he's always instructed me to do the same. It means, among **a lot** of other things, that he also does that kind of wasteful things for her. Including things like letting a alcohol-wet paper towel near things, so she knows that the item has already been cleaned up. x)  \nRecently, he became worse. Dad is very prone to any kind of conspiracy, and, in the last couple months, he's been watching videos of a \"professor\" who is \u2014 brace yourself! \u2014 openly ANTI-SUSTAINABILITY. yes, that man says that \"the lie of sustainability\" will end humanity, that it is a government-communist-globalist project of power/control... well, I don't know details, but I guess you got the point already.  \nSo, problem is: he was already damaging BEFORE he was watching those kind of things, and now he is almost porpusefully wasteful. In fact, he even keeps me from being openly ecofriendly.  \nAlthough he's very different from Mom, he's also very pedant and arrogant in his own way, so trying to talk him out of it is also a no-no. \n\n**WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO**  \nAt this point, you may have guessed that I'm considering moving out as soon as it becomes financially possible for me, which, sadly, can take some time. I need to save around \\~$20,000 to safely move out, and it is a LOT of money to reach around here! Oof!  \nWell, truth is that I'll have to stick in here for some more time  \u2014 becaus of it, I've been thinking about adopting a harm-reduction-policy. I won't be able to switch to full zero-waste for as long as I'm at my parents, but I'll try to do what I can (without getting involved in any more fights, I hope).  \nSilently using specific cloths for what they love to use paper towels; try to buy things only if strictly necessary and at the highest volume possible, so I can avoid financing more plastic packages; separating the trash so I can send to recycle centers... what, wait. RECYLING IS A SCAM?? WHAT DO I DO, THEN?!  \nI really want to do my part. I'm sure that when I move out I'll be able to be anything that I want, including the ecofriendly independent pretty woman I've wanted to be for so long, but... while I'm here, what the heck should I do (or not do)? I'm looking for little things that I can discreetly incorporate in my routines that should reduce impact \u2014 without it being an empty work.  \nThis piece of information about recycling really made me lose perspective on what I should focus on while I'm on this damage-management regimen.   \n\n\n**\\*TL;DR:**  I've read that recycling is a scam and I'm not sure on what can I do then. My parents are anti-enviromentalists and keep me from living sustainably. I need input about what can I do to reduce environmental harm when I'm in a situation where I can do almost nothing.   \n\n\n*Disclaimer: please, don't suggest anything in the lines of \"confront them! be courageous!\".*   \n*It may be a weakness of mine, but at the moment I really don't have the mental and physical health to do that anymore. It is always more than stressful and it has never have never been worth it.

And it's not just e-waste, it's recycling in general. He says that since he would have to take recycling down 5 flights of stairs and walk across a large parking lot to reach the central recycling bins of the apartment complex he lives in, he never does any recycling either and just throws everything in the garbage (there is central garbage disposal on each floor). However, he says that since he doesn't own a vehicle, therefore that alone more than offsets the amount of waste he has improperly disposed of.\n\nEven though I am all about disposing waste properly, I emphasize with his situation and realize that it is not fair to force somebody in such life circumstances to properly recycle.\n\nThis got me thinking, since this is actually relevant to how wealthy ppl say that they recycle and compost much more than average, and often has the time and money to properly dispose waste (motor oil to a proper location, e-waste to a proper location, construction supplies to a specialized location, etc). However, since wealthy people often own more cars and drive more, and the cars they own often pollute more either due to high performance or physical materials (a Rolls Royce probably has a carbon footprint 10x larger than Honda Civic, for example), does the fact that they dispose of everything properly offset the fact that their lifestyle inherently pollutes more?\n\nAnd this also relates to the \"reduce, reuse, recycle\" order of importance whereas reduce has a larger impact than reuse, and reuse which in turn has a larger impact than recycle. I think the fact that the aforementioned person doesn't have a car, and lives in an apartment (not a nice one either, but realize that I am not judging him, just merely stating the facts) means that he is massively \"reducing\" which offsets how he is not recycling.\n\nFinally, this also relates to the truth about how ppl in developing countries such as India, don't have large scale recycling facilities generally speaking, but since they don't buy much in the first place, and tend to have well-established reusing systems (families will pass items to another family, for example), developing countries have significantly lower carbon footprint per capita."}, {"title": "Just put in a Recycled Driveway", "text": "My driveway was gravel & washed away 3 times this year.

The truth is that most of the plastic is downcycled. \n\nRecycling in essence means, take a product and through a mechanical or chemical process create the same product again, to be used for the same purpose that it was first manufactured for. For example, a PET mineral water bottle once recycled should be converted into a PET mineral bottle again to package water. \n\nAs of now PET is mostly downcycled into fiber used to make clothing, which then ends up in the landfill once it reaches it end of life. This is what we call elongated linear consumption, where the original product is given a different from to elongate the pain and propagate a false sense of doing the right thing. \n\nTrue recycling is always circular, such as in the case of metals, or the extraction of precious metals from E-waste, Lithium, cobalt and other materials from lithium ion batteries. \n\nNote: It all starts with the design process, selecting materials keeping LCA in mind."}, {"title": "Schools can recycle markers with Crayola", "text": "I just found this website, it seems that K-12 schools can collect markers of all types and send them to Crayola for free recycling!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.crayola.com/colorcycle.aspx](https://www.crayola.com/colorcycle.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone been involved in this, or seen it work?

However, there is no place near me that will provide any clear detail on what they will or will not take. I don't want to harm recycling workers since some recycling is done manually. Also, it is not clear that metal recycling is even successful. Who knows if it is actually getting recycled or not. I am posting this in the hope of providing advice that I wished I should have received a long time ago. Some places do recycle blades but those places are the exceptions not the rule. \n\nThe truth is that shaving with a straight razor like the old days and using shaving soap rather than the aerosol cannister is the best way to go to reduce your footprint, anything else is just copium in terms of logistics. It cut consumptions at the source, using a single blade that can last for years and can be recycled easily. I hope that anybody out there who wants to be more sustainable in shaving will look at this as an option instead of the hype behind double edge razor shaving.
