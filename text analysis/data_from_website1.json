The underlying data held in WasteDataFlow is also used extensively by local and central government, the waste industry, and the public. Data is reported by all local authorities, often from management information supplied by their waste management contractor.", "109": "Factors affecting household waste recycling range from individual household behaviours, the advice and collection services provided by local authorities, the cost of waste treatment and disposal, and to some extent, wider issues such as the state of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some quarterly waste data shows a clear seasonal fluctuation. For example, the generation of garden waste is highly seasonal, increasing sharply and pushing up recycling rates in the spring and summer months. For this reason, comparisons should be made with the same quarter in previous years or using full 12-month periods. However, it should be remembered that in 2020/21 changes between years are obscured by the effects COVID-19, particularly in the period from April to September.", "110": "Prior to 2020/21 about 87 per cent of all waste managed by local authorities is \u2018waste from households\u2019 with the remainder coming from street cleaning, parks and grounds, business and construction.

WasteDataFlow is a UK-wide system managed by Defra in collaboration with Devolved Administration partners that is used to record the collection, treatment and disposal of local authority waste. First results using this database were produced for 2004/05 with earlier estimates of waste available from the Municipal Waste Management Surveys.", "115": "The tonnage of waste \u2018sent for reuse, recycling and composting\u2019 is that which is accepted by the re-processor. As such, it excludes any recycling rejects that occur during collection, sorting or further treatment. Waste diverted for recycling from the residual (or \u2018black bag waste\u2019) stream by further processing is included in the recycling tonnages.", "116": "In December 2017, a change in how metal recovered and recycled after incineration of waste (IBA metal) is treated and reported for the \u2018waste from households\u2019 dataset only was introduced. The tonnage of IBA metal is now included within recycling rather than being reported as \u2018recovery\u2019. The amount varies depending on the amount of residual waste being incinerated and the metal content of the residual waste.", "117": "Inclusion of IBA metal has been facilitated through the new Q100 reporting structure for waste treatment, which all local authorities have been using since April 2015 (see below). This has provided the opportunity for more complete recording of waste treatment, including outputs from incineration. Therefore estimates were produced for 2015, but it was not possible to backdate figures in a consistent manner prior to 2015 due to changes in the question structure and reporting that were introduced from April 2015 through Q100.", "118": "The majority of local authorities are reporting this information as fully as they are able to. This methodological change for IBA metal has been applied to the \u2018waste from households\u2019 measure only. It has been applied to data from April 2015\u2014it is not possible to apply the change to data before then as the question structure used to report waste treatment was different and, therefore, the reporting of IBA metal was not as consistent or as complete. At an overall England level, this change in methodology raised the recycling rate for 2016 by 0.7 percentage points (equivalent to 143 thousand tonnes). For 2015, the \u2018waste from households\u2019 recycling rate was increased by 0.4 percentage points (equivalent to 97 thousand tonnes). This is a slight underestimate for the impact on 2015 as data for January to March 2015 was collected using the old question structure and, as such, did not fully-capture IBA metal for this quarter; estimated to be around 23 thousand tonnes. Overall, this change in methodology results in \u2018waste from household\u2019 recycling rates being slightly higher than where IBA metal would previously have been reported as \u2018recovery\u2019.", "119": "There are no such methodological changes to the dataset for all local authority waste or \u2018household waste\u2019 recycling.

This question replaced a number of treatment questions.", "121": "Q100 provides a more flexible structure that has enabled local authorities to report a more complete and transparent representation of the more complex waste treatment practices that occur, which could not be accurately captured under the old question structure. It also provides the opportunity for local authorities to report, in more detail, the further treatment and disposal of certain waste types such as refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which would have previously been a final output. This is highly specific to the local authority and the facilities and practices used for treatment and disposal.", "122": "All local authorities provide data into WasteDataFlow. Several stages of data validation are carried out by the local authority submitting the data, the WasteDataFlow contractor and Defra, with input from the Environment Agency.", "123": "The WasteDataFlow contractors check each return for completeness and data consistency against key standardised validation checks. Data is checked against appropriate threshold values specified, which take into account the expected level of variance. There is an online validation process that compares the data for the current quarter against the data for the equivalent quarter in the previous year. For 2020/21 validation check thresholds were adjusted to take account of the COVID-19 pandemic, this was to try and reduce the number of queries raised with local authorities, so that they were not overwhelmed by validation queries as tonnages of different waste streams changed dramatically due to suspended waste collections, increased waste arisings at the kerbside, and large reductions in C&I wate streams.", "124": "Once the data has been validated by the contractor, further validation checks are carried out by Defra, who may also refer some to the Environment Agency on any specific data queries raised, particularly related to the appropriate recording of treatment and facility sites. The Defra checks include trend and outlier analysis on key measures at an aggregate and individual local authority level. Details of the validation process carried out by the contractor are available on the WasteDataFlow website.", "125": "The introduction of Q100 provided scope for local authorities to report more fully on the treatment and final destination of waste. This is particularly the case for incineration of waste and subsequent outputs and their final treatment and disposal. Gathering such information can be challenging, especially where waste goes through multiple different sorting and treatment processes at different facilities. In most cases, local authorities are able to supply this information, but in some cases full final destination treatment is not given or is stated as \u2018unknown\u2019. This may have a small impact on the final figures. Defra will continue to monitor this and work with local authorities to enhance data quality assurance, consistency, and completeness of reporting.", "126": "The Waste (Circular Economy) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 require Waste Management Plans to include measures to be taken to ensure that the preparing for reuse and the recycling of municipal waste is a minimum of 65% by weight by 2035 and to ensure the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight) by 2035.", "127": "National Statistics status means that our statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value, and it is our responsibility to maintain compliance with these standards.", "128": "In 2020 these local authority waste & recycling statistics together with those published by the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland underwent a compliance review by the \u201cOffice for Stats Regulation\u201d (OSR), who monitor government statistical quality.", "129": "National statistics accreditation for these statistics was maintained at this review.

The difference is that \u2018waste from households\u2019 excludes local authority collected waste types not considered to have come directly from households, such as street bins, street sweepings, parks and grounds waste, and compost-like output (CLO) from Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) plants. As explained above under \u2018Methodology\u2019 and \u2018Data Notes and Development\u2019, we have introduced a change to the \u2018waste from households\u2019 recycling calculation to now include metal recovered after incineration (IBA metal).
